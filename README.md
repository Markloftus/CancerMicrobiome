# CancerMicrobiome
This repository contains python notebooks used in studying the bacterial association networks in the late-stage colorectal cancer associated gut microbiome.

Some files are larger than 25Mb so they had to be zipped.

Make sure to unzip all files that are zipped otherwise the code will break.
